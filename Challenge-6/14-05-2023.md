## Algorithms: Coding Puzzles
**Title:**      

    How many steps are needed to disconnect the string?

**Problem:**      

    A secure communication network has been compromised and the cyber security team must restore its security. The network, series, is represented as a series of nodes identified using lowercase English letters. The nodes must be disconnected in order to remove the threat. In a single operation, any number of adjacent nodes identified by the same character can be disconnected. Find the minimum number of operations required to disconnect all the nodes and secure the network.

**Language:**   
                
    Python

**Code:**     
```python
def find_minimum_deletion(left_index, right_index, dp, string):
  """
  Finds the minimum number of deletions required in a string.
  
  Arguments:
      left_index: The left index of the substring.
      right_index: The right index of the substring.
      dp: Dynamic programming table to store intermediate results.
      string: The input string.
  
  Returns:
      int: The minimum number of deletions required.
  """
  # Base cases
  if left_index > right_index:
      return 0
  if left_index == right_index:
      return 1
  
  # Check if the result is already computed
  if dp[left_index][right_index] != -1:
      return dp[left_index][right_index]
  
  # Initialize the result
  result = 1 + find_minimum_deletion(left_index + 1, right_index, dp, string)
  
  # Iterate through the substring and find the minimum
  for i in range(left_index + 1, right_index + 1):
      if string[left_index] == string[i]:
          result = min(result, find_minimum_deletion(left_index + 1, i - 1, dp, string) +
                       find_minimum_deletion(i, right_index, dp, string))
  
  # Store the result in the dynamic programming table
  dp[left_index][right_index] = result
  return result
