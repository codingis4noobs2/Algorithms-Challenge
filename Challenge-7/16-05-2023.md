## Algorithms: Coding Puzzles
**Title:**      

    What is the score?

**Problem:**      

    In this final puzzle, we bring you to Mars. That’s right - you’re an astronaut now. As part of
    the expedition, you’re required to look for lifeforms on the planet. You pull up your scanner,
    and scan scan scan. Unexpectedly, your sensor starts picking up things! However, your space budget didn’t quite
    cover scientific equipment and you'll have to make do with its abilities. The sensor scans an
    area that fits into a 5x5 grid. The scan shows lifeforms (X), and empty spaces (.)
    
    Consider the following start state:
    XXXX.
    X....
    X..X.
    .X.X.
    XX.XX
    What is the lifeform score for the first layout that appears twice?

**Language:**   
                
    Python

**Code:**     
```python
def get_adjacent_tiles(index):
    """
    Helper function to get the indices of adjacent tiles given the index of a tile.
    """
    adjacent = []
    if index % 5 != 0:
        adjacent.append(index - 1)  # Left tile
    if index % 5 != 4:
        adjacent.append(index + 1)  # Right tile
    if index >= 5:
        adjacent.append(index - 5)  # Top tile
    if index < 20:
        adjacent.append(index + 5)  # Bottom tile
    return adjacent


def evolve_lifeforms(start_state):
    """
    Simulates the evolution of lifeforms according to the given rules until a layout appears twice.
    Returns the lifeform score of the first repeated layout.
    """
    layouts = {}  # Dictionary to store seen layouts
    current_state = start_state
    minute = 0

    while True:
        layout = ''.join(current_state)  # Convert the list of characters to a string for easy comparison

        if layout in layouts:
            # Found a repeated layout
            first_occurrence = layouts[layout]
            return sum(2**i for i, tile in enumerate(layout) if tile == 'X')  # Calculate the lifeform score

        layouts[layout] = minute
        minute += 1

        next_state = current_state.copy()

        for i, tile in enumerate(current_state):
            adjacent_tiles = get_adjacent_tiles(i)
            num_adjacent_lifeforms = sum(1 for adj in adjacent_tiles if current_state[adj] == 'X')

            if tile == 'X':
                if num_adjacent_lifeforms != 1:
                    next_state[i] = '.'
            else:
                if num_adjacent_lifeforms == 1 or num_adjacent_lifeforms == 2:
                    next_state[i] = 'X'

        current_state = next_state


# Example start state
start_state = [
    'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', '.',
    'X', '.', '.', '.', '.',
    'X', '.', '.', 'X', '.',
    '.', 'X', '.', 'X', '.',
    'X', 'X', '.', 'X', 'X'
]

lifeform_score = evolve_lifeforms(start_state)
print("Lifeform score:", lifeform_score)
```
 
 **Solution:** 
 
    Lifeform score: 32509983
    
**Time Complexity**: **O(m * n * 2^n)**

**Space Complexity**: **O(2^n * n)**
