## Algorithms: Coding Puzzles
**Title:**      

    Question: Whoâ€™s the fastest runner?

**Problem:**      

    Here are the descriptions of this group of friends: 
    1) John can run 10 m/s for 6 seconds, but then must rest for 20 seconds 
    2) James can run 8 m/s for 8 seconds, but then must rest for 25 seconds 
    3) Jenna can run 12 m/s for 5 seconds, but then must rest for 16 seconds 
    4) Josh can run 7 m/s for 7 seconds, but then must rest for 23 seconds 
    5) Jacob can run 9 m/s for 4 seconds, but then must rest for 32 seconds 
    6) Jerry can run 5 m/s for 9 seconds, but then must rest for 18 seconds 
    After 1234 seconds, what is the distance of the winning runner?

**Algorithm:**  
                        
    1. Start
    2. Define a function calculate_distance that takes runner_speed, run_time, rest_time, and total_time as input.
    3.     Calculate the cycle_time by adding the run_time and rest_time.
    4.     Calculate the number of full cycles completed in total_time by performing integer division of total_time by cycle_time.
    5.     Calculate the remaining time after completing the full cycles by finding the modulo of total_time and cycle_time.
    6.     Initialize distance to 0.
    7.     If the number of full cycles is greater than 0, calculate the distance covered in the full cycles by multiplying full_cycles, runner_speed, and run_time, and add it to the distance.
    8.     If there is remaining time, check if it is greater than or equal to the run_time. If true, add the distance covered in run_time to distance. Otherwise, add the distance covered in the remaining time to distance.
    9.     Return the final distance.
    10. Set total_time to 1234.
    11. Calculate the distance covered by each runner using the calculate_distance function and store the values.
    12. Print the distances for each runner.
    13. End

    
           
**Language:**   
                
    Python

**Code:**     
```python
def calculate_distance(runner_speed: int, run_time: int, rest_time: int, total_time: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the distance covered by a runner given their speed, run time, rest time, and total time.

    Args:
        runner_speed (int): Speed of the runner in meters per second.
        run_time (int): Time the runner runs without taking rest in seconds.
        rest_time (int): Time the runner rests in seconds.
        total_time (int): Total time in seconds.

    Returns:
        int: Distance covered by the runner.
    """
    distance_covered = 0
    cycle_time = run_time + rest_time
    full_cycles = total_time // cycle_time
    remaining_time = total_time % cycle_time
    distance_covered += full_cycles * runner_speed * run_time

    # Calculate the distance covered in the remaining time
    if remaining_time >= run_time:
        distance_covered += runner_speed * run_time
    else:
        distance_covered += runner_speed * remaining_time

    return distance_covered


total_time = 1234

# Calculate distances covered by each runner
runners = [
    ("John", calculate_distance(10, 6, 20, total_time)),
    ("James", calculate_distance(8, 8, 25, total_time)),
    ("Jenna", calculate_distance(12, 5, 16, total_time)),
    ("Josh", calculate_distance(7, 7, 23, total_time)),
    ("Jacob", calculate_distance(9, 4, 32, total_time)),
    ("Jerry", calculate_distance(5, 9, 18, total_time))
]

# Find the runner with the highest distance
max_distance = 0
winner = ""

for runner, distance in runners:
    if distance > max_distance:
        max_distance = distance
        winner = runner

# Print the distances for each runner
print("Runners Distances:")
for runner, distance in runners:
    print(f"Distance covered by {runner}: {distance} meters")

# Print the winner
print(f"\nThe Winner is {winner} with a total distance covered of {max_distance} meters.")
 ```
 
 **Output:** 
 
    Runners Distances:
    Distance covered by John: 2880 meters
    Distance covered by James: 2432 meters
    Distance covered by Jenna: 3540 meters
    Distance covered by Josh: 2037 meters
    Distance covered by Jacob: 1260 meters
    Distance covered by Jerry: 2070 meters
    
    The Winner is Jenna with a total distance covered of 3540 meters.
    
**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(1)** since it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also **O(1)** since the algorithm only uses a constant amount of additional space to store intermediate variables.
