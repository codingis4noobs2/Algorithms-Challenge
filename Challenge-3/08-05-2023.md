**Title:**      

    Question: Is the permutation divisible by 7?

**Problem:**      

    What youâ€™ll need to do is determine if any of the permutations of 1867 are divisible by 7, and if so, what is the average between the smallest and largest permutation? Decimals are allowed.

**Algorithm:**  
                        
    1. Start
    2. Get all possible permutations of the given string.
    3. If the permutation is divisble by 7, add it into a list.
    4. Get max. and min. value from that list.
    5. Do Average of the min. and max. values.
    6. Print the Average.
    7. End
    
           
**Language:**   
                
    Python

**Code:**     
```python
from itertools import permutations


def get_permutations(num_str: str) -> list:
    """
    Generates all permutations of a given integer string.
    
    Args:
        num_str (string): Numbers in form of string
        
    Returns:
        list: all possible permutations of the given string
    """
    digits = list(num_str)
    perm_list = permutations(digits)
    perm_nums = [''.join(perm) for perm in perm_list]
    return perm_nums


def find_divisible_permutations(num_str: str) -> float:
    """
    Finds the divisible permutations and calculates the average
    between the smallest and largest divisible permutations.
    
    Args:
        num_str (string): Numbers in form of string

    Returns:
        float: Average of the maximum and minimum permutations.
    """
    permutations = get_permutations(num_str)
    divisible_perms = []

    for perm in permutations:
        num = int(perm)
        if num % 7 == 0:
            divisible_perms.append(num)

    if len(divisible_perms) == 0:
        return "No divisible permutations found."

    smallest_perm = min(divisible_perms)
    largest_perm = max(divisible_perms)
    average = (smallest_perm + largest_perm) / 2

    return average


# Driver code
integer_string = "1867"
average = find_divisible_permutations(integer_string)
print("Average of divisible permutations:", average)
 ```
 
 **Output:** 
 
    Average of divisible permutations: 5152.0
    
**Time Complexity**: **O(n * n!)**
**Space Complexity**: **O(n!)**
