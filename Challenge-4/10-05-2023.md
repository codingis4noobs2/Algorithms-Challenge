    Find the groupâ€™s efficiency

**Problem:**      

    A group of workers gathered to complete a task. Each worker has an efficiency rating. They
    will be grouped in pairs so an even number of workers are required. The cost of a pair is the
    absolute difference of the efficiencies assigned to the workers. The cost of the task is the
    sum of the costs of all pairs formed. There are an odd number of workers to choose from, so
    one worker will not be paired. Select the worker to exclude so the task's cost is minimized.
    Given n workers and efficiency for each worker, find a configuration of the workers such that
    the cost of the task is the minimum possible. Return the minimum cost as the answer.
    What is the minimum cost of this array of efficiencies:
    [1, 3, 54, 712, 52, 904, 113, 12, 135, 32, 31, 56, 23, 79, 611, 123, 677, 232, 997, 101, 111,
    123, 2, 7, 24, 57, 99, 45, 666, 42, 104, 129, 554, 335, 876, 35, 15, 93, 13]

**Algorithm:**  
                        
    1. Start
    2. Sort the array
    3. Set min_cost to inifity(basically max. value
    4. Loop through the array
    5.    Set cost to 0
    6.    Initiate another loop that traverses from start to end with a jump of 2
    7.        If i and j are equal, then add the diff. between eff[j+2] and eff[j+1] to cost
    8.        Else, add the diff. between eff[j+1] and eff[j] to cost
    9.    Check the if the cost is less than min_cost, then assign cost to min_cost
    10. Print min_cost
    11. End
           
**Language:**   
                
    Python

**Code:**     
```python
from typing import List

def minimum_cost_efficiency(efficiencies: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Args:
       efficiencies (list): efficiencies of all workers 
    
    Returns:
        int: min_cost
    """
    efficiencies.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
    min_cost = float('inf')  # Initialize min_cost with positive infinity

    # Iterate through the array, excluding one worker at a time
    for i in range(len(efficiencies)):
        cost = 0
        for j in range(1, len(efficiencies), 2):
            # Calculate the cost of pairing workers
            cost += abs(efficiencies[j] - efficiencies[j - 1])
        # Update min_cost if the calculated cost is less
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)

        # Rotate the array to exclude a different worker in the next iteration
        efficiencies.append(efficiencies.pop(0))

    return min_cost


# Driver code
efficiencies = [79, 93, 99, 101, 104, 111, 113, 123, 123, 129, 135, 232, 335, 554, 611, 666, 677]
min_cost = minimum_cost_efficiency(efficiencies)
print(min_cost)
 ```
